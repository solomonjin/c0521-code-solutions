          You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that
          we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on investment.
          Our goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this determination
          one way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application
          for you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current customers
          to talk about their experience.

          Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community resources.
          At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling your payers with
          our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll also load your
          preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that sending referrals and
          closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health information exchanges
          or other information technology vendors are important, we will work with you to determine
          what we can deliver and when.

          The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which we
          have executed successfully with obth remotely hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our
          work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demogrpahics and information like medications, problems
          and allergies is relatively straightforward. While importing clinical notes and documents is
          more challenging, our team has been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide
          variety of EMRs.

          We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content, charge
          schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks prior to go-live
          to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice management, and billing workflows.
          Either before or during go-live, one of our team can visit your practice to work side-by-side
          with you on implementation and training.

          Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be
          with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure
          everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a handful of
          encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates, setting up new
          automations, modifying practice management settings, and more. We are here to help with it

          All EMR contracts should contain assurances broken promises and provide support over
          the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not meeting expectations,
          you can terminate the agreement and receive all payments back. (We do not expect this to happen).
           For our standard plans, we also offer a MIPS guarntee: if you receive a negative adjustment,
           we will cover it. And for everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We
           expect this to be a long, productive partnership for us both.
